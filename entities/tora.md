A total of 2222+12 TORAs will be released in 4 phases on Opensea, with 52+12 categories (a/e) and 8+1 tiers. While the majority of the works will be available through public sale, a set number of TORAs will be airdropped to the founding members of our community, and some will be rewarded to collectors who have acquired enough works to unlock certain achievements. How TORAs are distributed in different phases will be announced later in our community.
