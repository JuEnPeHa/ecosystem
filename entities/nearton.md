"NEARton is a DeFi strategy game based on NFT Staking and a beautiful gallery for your assets, powered by NEAR Protocol.

First of all, NEARton is NFT Collection itself. Each house is NFT with its own rarity attributes.

We will have a map of the town, and a shareable gallery page for each house to show off your home and your other NFTs.

We're going to gamify the NFT staking process with rarities, boosters, and the ability to stake NFTs from other well-known collections. So, the combination of all your NFTs will affect your $NEXP rewards rate.

You can spend $NEXP inside (and we hope outside) the town on additional accessories for your houses, gambling, self-promotion on local radio, and other fun stuff.

After NFTs distribution, we're going to create a DAO for all holders. DAO will decide which other collections to partner with for staking."
