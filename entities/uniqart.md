UniqART is a 360-degree solution to empower Indian artists. We want to provide a 3 point solution for the artists:

- Awareness about Web3.0 (NFTs, marketplaces)
- Assistance in funding (decentralized crowdfunding)
- Allocation of power

With 200 million-plus active listeners, the Indian music industry is one of the fastest-growing music industries in the world with global appeal.

At UniqART, we aim to create an inclusive and comfortable environment for musicians, which gives them freedom to establish a 2 way interaction with their community facilitated via NFTâ€™s.
