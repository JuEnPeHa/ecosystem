Campground is a blockchain-powered content creation/curation tool and marketplace pioneering the Web3 creator economy. At Campground people build trails, essentially interactive digital content tours that serve a wide variety of use cases. Creators then mint and sell their trails as NFT access tokens to a trail's corresponding content and community.  Beneath Campground's DApp we've developed EMOJI token, designed as an underlying Web3 protocol to reward social reactions, index by emotion, and validate content for quality/accuracy via crowd consensus with prediction market dynamics. EMOJI is not only core to Campground, but a foundational protocol on which the broad decentralized creator economy will be built.
